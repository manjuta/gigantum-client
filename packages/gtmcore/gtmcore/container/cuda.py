# To interpret this data, cuda version 10.0 requires driver > 410.58

# e.g., if two cards are supported with different minimum versions, we only support the highest minimum
# At time of edit, we have explicitly tested through version 430
# Note that we don't support CUDA 8, but we don't disable it (yet)
